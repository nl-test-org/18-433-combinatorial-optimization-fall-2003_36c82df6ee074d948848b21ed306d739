Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisite
------------

[18.06](/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2005) Linear Algebra or 18.700 Linear Algebra.

Description
-----------

The course will present a thorough introduction to the fundamental algorithmic techniques of Discrete Mathematics - Linear and Convex Programming, Flow & Matching Theory, Randomization, and Approximation. We will tackle a variety of optimization problems by applying these techniques to find efficient algorithms.

Topics include

*   How fast can a maximum matching be found in a graph?
*   Why is the maximum flow equal to the minimum cut?
*   What is duality and how to make use of it?
*   Is optimization reducible to random sampling?
*   Is there a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming?
*   How to find a short traveling salesman tour?
*   How to find disjoint flow paths?

Format
------

In addition to 3 hours of lectures each week, students will have regular assignments, and two in-class exams. There will also be a course project which can be either theoretical (e.g. write a report, solve an open problem) or practical (e.g. evaluate an algorithm).

Project
-------

For the course project you will:

1.  Work on a problem and/or experimentally evaluate an algorithm;
2.  Write a short report and present your findings to class.

Students can work individually or in pairs.  
Projects should be set up by the day after session #5.
